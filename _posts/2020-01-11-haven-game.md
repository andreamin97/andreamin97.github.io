Haven RPG is a project that has been brewing for a few years now; it's a game that was born out of the tiredness of always finding something off in other role-playing games. So I decided to pick things I liked from the various RPGs I played and modify them so that they work together.

Haven is primarily being made for short campaigns and one shots: the character creation is vary fast and it should be able to provide multiple combinations to entice players to try different characters.

But is also deadly, combat should never be the first answer to any problem, and players should always be thinking laterally to overcome challenges.

Also for this reason, the progression is quite horizontal, characters don't become more powerful as they gain experience, but rather they gain more tools to solve problems.

The game for now is classic fantasy ideally sent in the city of Haven and surroundings. Haven is a pirate city in the middle of mostly unexplored territories; imagine "Black Sails" meets "The Lord of the Rings". Unfortunately the setting is still in the works, but the first draft of the game manual is out :)
