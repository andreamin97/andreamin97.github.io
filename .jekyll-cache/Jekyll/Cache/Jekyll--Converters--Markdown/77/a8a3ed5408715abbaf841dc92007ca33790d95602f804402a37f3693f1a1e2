I"ç<p>I have quite a few things that I‚Äôd love to try for the module: one is a parkour system that tries to put together the ease of <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed</em> parkour, with <em>Mirror‚Äôs Edge</em> freedom; another one is a differet approach to CCGs, trying to get away from the MtG formula (while actually taking inspiration from a MtG minigame, which I find quite ironic). I had actually started working on this this summer and would absolutely love to do it, but I really don‚Äôt wanna do any networking right now.</p>

<p>And finally the idea that I acutally wanna pursue first, this one also has been in my head for quite a while, going through some changes while being played in my head and I really want to try the different versions in an actual game: a PvE (ideally a rogue-lite to be precise) auto-battler.</p>

<p>Now, some mobile games actually kind of have a similar mode, I know AFK arena doeas for sure, but given the business model  of these kind of games, it ends up losing everything that is fun about Autochess and its offspring: the drafting of your team and trying to make the best team composition you can with what the game gives you.</p>

<p>Now, the (maybe temporary, maybe not) name is a tribute to Gary Gygax and his Dragonchess game, as my game also takes some inspiration from <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>.
This insipiration comes in what is the biggest deviation from the standard autobattler: unit leveling.</p>

<p>The new leveling mechanic would be the main one I‚Äôd be focusing my effort for the module, as it‚Äôs quite the drastic change, normally you would level up a unit by merging it with other two units of the same type and level</p>
