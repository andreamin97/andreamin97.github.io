I"ı<p>After some playtesting, the necessity for some more explicit synergies has become pretty evident; but I still wanna try to stay away from the way Autobattlers have done it so far: I donâ€™t want them to be completely explicit, but closer to what card games do with archetypes, I want to encourage players to use some units together, but also not force them and let them experiment and find unorthodox combinations.</p>

<p>I decided to start with just 3 archetypes and add some slight overlapping in units. The archetypes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vanguards: The most basic archetype, in CCGs terms, it would be the quintessential midrange. Stereotypical bruisers, good survivability, good damage, and good crowd controls, but donâ€™t excell in anything. Mostly melee.</li>
  <li>Spells Matter: The â€œcomboâ€ archetype, the units have very clear windows of power; are very reliant on their abilities.</li>
  <li>Berserkers: The â€œaggroâ€ archetype, what they lack in survivability they get into raw damage.</li>
</ul>
