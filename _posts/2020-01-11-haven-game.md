HavenRPG is a simple to learn role-playing game system, specifically designed for short campaigns, one-shot sessions and “West Marches” campaigns.\n
Due to the types of games this systems is designed for, the character creation is very fast(~10 minutes) and provides multiple combinations to entice players to try different characters.

One of my main focus was to create an horizontal character progression: characters don't become more powerful as they gain experience, but rather they gain more tools to solve problems.
