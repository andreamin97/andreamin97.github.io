## Attacking 
Attacking is an opposed roll between the two involed parties, if the attack roll is equal or greater than the defend roll, the attack is successful and can roll the damage.
On a Natural 20, you incurr on a _Critical Strike_ or _Critical Defense_, these always prevail on non natural 20 rolls and grants additional benefits:

### Critical Strike
On a Critical Strike you gain advantage on the damage roll and, based on the weapon's damage type, the following effect:
- _Bludgeoning_: if the enemy armor is a heavy armor, deal 1d4 damage to it.
- _Piercing_: if the enemy armor is a medium armor, deal 1d4 damage to it.
- _Slashing_: if the enemy armor is a light armor, deal 1d4 damage to it.

### Critical Defense
On a Critical Defense, based on the skill you're using to defend yourself, you may:
##### Fight:
- _Knock Prone_
- _Disarm_
- _Parry_ : make an attack against your attacker. He is overwhelmed until his next turn.

### Defend
You can defend yourself an amount of times equal to your number of attacks, after that you get the status ___overwhelmed___ until your next turn.

##### Arcana:
- _Stun_ (1 round)
- _Blink_ in any direction, up to 15ft

## Armor
Whenever a piece of equipment grants you armor, it is added to you armor total. The __Armor Total__ divided by 2 is your __Armor Modifier__.
Whenever you take damage, you prevent a flat value of that damage equal to your __Armor Modifier__.

Your __Armor Total__ can be permanently damaged, when it happens it affects the __Armor Modifier__ until it gets repaired (if possible).

# Statuses
- __Overwhelmed__: You have disadvantage on all defend rolls.
- __Prone__: You must spend you full turn to get back on your feet. You are _Overwhelmed_ while prone.
- __Disarmed__: You must use your movement action to get back your weapon. You cant use _Fight_ to defend.
- __Stunned__: You skip your turn, and cant take any actions for the duration.
