I"8<p>After some playtesting, the necessity for some more explicit synergies has become pretty evident; but I still wanna try to stay away from the way Autobattlers have done it so far: I don’t want them to be completely explicit, but closer to what card games do with archetypes, I want to encourage players to use some units together, but also not force them and let them experiment and find unorthodox combinations.</p>

<p>I decided to start with just 3 archetypes and add some slight overlapping in units. The archetypes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vanguards: The most basic archetype, in CCGs terms, it would be the quintessential midrange. Stereotypical bruisers, good survivability, good damage, and good crowd controls, but don’t excel in anything. Mostly melee.</li>
  <li>Spells Matter: The “combo” archetype, the units have very clear windows of power; are very reliant on their abilities.</li>
  <li>Berserkers: The “aggro” archetype, what they lack in survivability they get into raw damage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then I need to define the sub-categorization of units to define their role in their archetypes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Core: the most important units of the archetype, without at least one of them the plan falls apart.</li>
  <li>Enablers: Help to unleash the full potential of the core units.</li>
  <li>Support: Help filling in the holes the archetype might have and support the overall plan.</li>
  <li>Payoffs: Usually only tier 5 units, heavily reliant on one specific archetype, but when put into the right composition are extremely strong. Are not necessary for a strong team composition.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next thing to talk about is the subdivision into tiers.
There will be 5 tiers of units; a higher player level means a higher chance of finding higher tier units, but also lower tier units. This is pretty in line with how auto-battlers have done it so far.
Usually though, a higher tier unit has better base stats only. Given my removal of explicit synergies, I want to try to also give these units additional spells that work as a point of synergy within their archetype(s).
Right now I’m thinking of adding 1 additional spell every other level, ending with something like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tier 1 and 2: 1 spell</li>
  <li>Tier 3 and 4: 2 spells</li>
  <li>Tier 5 : 3 spells</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the number of units for each tier, my starting numbers are:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Tier</th>
      <th>Number of Unit</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For this week is all, now that I’ve put down the general stuff, I will go into details for each archetype and unit next week.</p>
