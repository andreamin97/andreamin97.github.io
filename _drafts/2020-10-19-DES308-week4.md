This one is going to be a very short one.

To start, the AI is going to be very simple: once the player clicks fight, every unit is going to look for the closest enemy and set it as its target, and it's not going to change it until it dies; it's going to move to the target position and attack him based on the unit's attack speed.

After this, I will focus on making an ability system and integrating it with the AI.
