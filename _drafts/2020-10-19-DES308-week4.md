It's time to start thiking about the base classes for the units.
After watching this very interestin video
I started looking at the units under a different light: they are the tools that the players uses to advance (or at least the main ones).
To try and somewhat follow the guidelines he gives on tools I ended up deciding that no units should just be a generalist, or at least if it is, it shouldn't be very good. 

I decided to have the following classes and then subclasse, these determine main role and specialization; moreover the class gives the ultimate ability (it's the same for all subclasses), but each subclass has a different basic ability.
The general idea is to have ultimates be medium power generalist spells (and somewhat overlapping with other class spells), while the subclass specific spell be powerful but highly specialized. This way it limits the strategic options at any given point in time.
