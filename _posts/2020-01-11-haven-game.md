HavenRPG is a simple to learn role-playing game system, specifically designed for short campaigns, one-shot sessions and “West Marches” campaigns.
Due to the types of games this systems is designed for, the character creation is very fast(~10 minutes) and provides multiple combinations to entice players to try different characters.

One of my main focus was to create an horizontal character progression: characters don't become more powerful as they gain experience, but rather they gain more tools to solve problems.

The game for now is classic fantasy ideally sent in the city of Haven and surroundings. Haven is a pirate city in the middle of mostly unexplored territories; imagine "Black Sails" meets "The Lord of the Rings". Unfortunately the setting is still in the works, but the third draft of the game manual is out :)
