I"¦<p>After some playtesting, the necessity for some more explicit synergies has become pretty evident; but I still wanna try to stay away from the way Autobattlers have done it so far: I donâ€™t want them to be completely explicit, but closer to what card games do with archetypes, I want to encourage players to use some units together, but also not force them and let them experiment and find unorthodox combinations.</p>
