The game puts you in control of a character that has "admin privileges" on the game, and can reprogram other actors of the game to try and fix them, before the whole project is scrapped by the developers.

For this project I designed and Implemented the programming system, working closely with my teammates who developed the puzzles. I also designed and implemented the UI.
